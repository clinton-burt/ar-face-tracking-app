This is a short python script that takes a folder of images and generates a texture atlas from it.
The images will be cropped to their non transparent bounding boxes. The script generates a CSS file and JSON file
that can be used together with the texture atlas as well as an illustrative SVG/animation showing how the texture atlas is created.

This is old BuildAtlasTexture_Original_DontUse.py script description above

Usage of BuildAtlasTextureSimple:

0) script suppose all images to have equal size and to be numbered continuously from 0.png to N.png
1) set GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE in the script file, if you need larger value and this size is supported by OpenGL
2) put your images into the "input" folder
3) start the script
4) if you got a GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE limit violation error, try to resize frames with ResizeImages with correct size factor
5) check the "output"
