ResizeImages.py

This is a short python script that takes a folder of images and resizes all the images with .png only extension and saves the result.
This can be useful for animation frames size reducing before packing them into a texture atlas to prevent GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE limit violation.

This is old BuildAtlasTexture_Original_DontUse.py script description above

Usage of BuildAtlasTextureSimple:

0) script works only with .png extension
1) set sizeFactor in the script file
2) put your images into the "input" folder
3) start the script
4) check the "output"
